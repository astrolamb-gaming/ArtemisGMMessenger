==========Artemis Game Master Comms Console=================

Artemis Game Master Comms Console (AGMCC) requires the use of Starry Wisdom's Hermes program for Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator (Artemis). 
AGMCC is intended to replace the stock Artemis GM console's comms system. Unlike stock, it allows for copy and pasting text into the text fields,
which can then be sent to the appropriate consoles/ships. 

A note on the differences between the different aspects:
Under the "Comms Message Options", these options determine under which filters the message will appear on the comms screen. 
A message can only be sent under one filter option.
Note that all comms messages, regardless of filter, go to ALL SHIPS!!

Popup messages, on the other hand, can be specified as to which ships and stations the message is sent to. 
Multiple ships and stations can be selected for sending popups.
